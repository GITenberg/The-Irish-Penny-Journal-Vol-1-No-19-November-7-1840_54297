<h2>GARRY CASTLE, KING’S COUNTY.</h2>

<p>Among the many singular characters who figured in Ireland
during the last century, by no means the least remarkable was
Thomas Coghlan, or Mac Coghlan, the last descendant of a
long and ancient family, the ruins of whose fortalice are the
subject of the sketch at the head of this article, at least as
they appeared some five or six years ago. This extraordinary
personage may justly be regarded as the last of the Irish
tanistry, as well from his pertinacious adherence to the habits
and maxims of that defunct institution, as from his being until
his death possessed of the princely domains of his race, almost
unimpaired by the many confiscations and revolutions which
have swept away so many proud names from the records of
Ireland, thus uniting in himself the influence of traditional
rank, of such magical weight here, with the influence of territorial
possessions, of such magical weight every where. Although
for many years a member of the Irish Parliament, as
representative for the King’s County, the laws which he assisted
in making were not at all the laws which he administered.
At home every thing was on the patriarchal system,
in all respects conformable to the laws and regulations of the
Brehons&mdash;himself the grand centre of all authority, his will
the fountain of all justice, and his own hand in most cases
the administrator of his judgments. Such being the Mac
Coghlan, or “the Maw,” as he was more generally and rather
whimsically designated, it is little wonder that he should live
in the fondest remembrance of a people so deeply attached to
old names and old ways as the Irish all over the King’s
County generally, but particularly in that district of it anciently
known as the Mac Coghlan’s country, now the barony
of Garry Castle, so called from the castle before alluded to, the
ruins of which stand beside the road leading from Birr to
Banagher, and about half a mile from the latter town.</p>

<p>These interesting remains consist of the tall square keep
seen in the accompanying view, and the mouldering walls of
some outer buildings, the entire enclosed in a considerable area,
with round towers at the corners, and entered by a fortified
gateway. They seem to be of some antiquity, this having
been the site, at all events, of the house of the Mac Coghlans<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
from the earliest periods, until the more peaceful circumstances
of the nation permitted them to abandon their narrow
and gloomy security for the beautiful residence of Kilcolgan,
an erection of the seventeenth century, the naked ruins of
which now form the chief feature in the landscape to the traveller
by the Grand Canal before he reaches Gillen. I am not
aware that any records exist to furnish a clue to the history
of Garry Castle, nor have I been able to meet any one able to
give me any information about it, beyond the usual tirade
about Oliver Cromwell, who seems doomed to bear on his back
the weight of all the old walls in Ireland. One very old man,
who in his youth had been, I believe, a servant of the Maw,
was the only person in fact who seemed to know more about
it than that it was “an ould castle, an’ a great place in the
ould times.” From him I gathered a good many anecdotes
of his former master, of which the following partly bears upon
the present subject, and gives rather a good illustration of a
class of persons not unfrequently met with, who occasionally
support most extraordinary pretensions by methods still more
extraordinary, claiming to be proficients in all the forgotten
lore of past ages, and even in their rags hinting at powers, the
possession of which would be rather enviable. The story is
an odd one, but I tell it exactly as I heard it.</p>

<p>“I had business into Banagher one day when I was a gossoon,
and just as I came to the bill over Garry Castle, I saw a
great crowd moving up the road forninst me. ‘Lord rest the
sowl that’s gone,’ says I, crossin’ myself, for by course I
thought it was a corpse goin’ to All Saints’ churchyard; but
when it came nearer, and I saw the Maw in the front with a
whole crowd of gentlemen, some that I knew and more that
I didn’t, and ne’er a corpse at all with them, I made bould to
ax Father Madden what might be the matther.</p>

<p>‘Why, my boy,’ says he, ‘there’s some gentlemen come all
the ways from Dublin to consther what’s written on the big
stone over the hall chimley in the ould castle beyant, and the
rest of us are going to have the laugh at their ignorance.’</p>

<p>‘’Deed, your riv’rince,’ says I, ‘an’ it’s the fine laugh we’ll
have in airnest, for sure the smallest gossoon in the country
could tell them ’twas written by the Danes long ago, and that
it’s an enchantment.’</p>

<p>‘Hould your tongue,’ says he in return; ‘whatever it is, I’ll
be bound it’ll puzzle them, for by the book I’m not able to
read it myself.’</p>

<p>‘Troth, thin,’ says I, ‘if that be the case, it’s little sense
the likes of them will make out of it.’</p>

<p>By this time, sir, we got inside the ould gateway, and as
the Maw’s groom was a cousin of my aunt Peg’s, he let me
into the hall with the rest of the quality. There was the
stone, sure enough: a long narrow stone, all the length of the
room, with four lines of writing cut on it, over the chimley.
It was in the part of the ould castle that’s down now. Well,
sir, one ould gentleman&mdash;they said he belonged to that college
off there in Dublin&mdash;takes his spectacles out of his pocket, an’
he puts them on his nose, quite grand like, and he looks at the
writing. ‘It’s not English,’ says he, ‘nor is it French,’ says
he after a little, ‘nor Jarman;’ and then he takes another
look. ‘It’s not Latin,’ says he, and the rest of the quality
shook their heads very wisely; ‘it’s not Greek,’ says he, and
they shook their heads again; ‘it’s not Hebrew,’ says he,
‘nor Chaldee, nor&mdash;pursuin’ to me if I know what it is.’</p>

<p>‘Baidershin!’ says Father Madden quietly: an’ with that,
sir, you’d think the vault above our heads ’ud split with the
roars of laughing. But the great scholar didn’t join in it at
all, but pulls the spectacles off his nose, and crams them into
his pocket, and looking very big at the priest, ‘I’m thinking
it’s Baulderdash, gentlemen,’ says he.</p>

<p>Well, sir, one after another they all tried their skill on it,
and one after another they all had to acknowledge their ignorance.</p>

<p>‘By the powers,’ says the priest, ‘by yer talk one ’ud think
the hiryglyphics themselves were a Readin’-med-aisy to ye, an’
here a plain bit of writin’ puzzles ye.’</p>

<p>‘Maybe, Father Madden,’ says the Maw, ‘you’d favour us
by consthering it yerself.’</p>

<p>‘No, sir,’ says the priest; ‘my vow won’t let me read magic;
but if you’d wish me to thransport the stone anywhere
for you, or do any other little miracle that way, I’d be most
happy to obleedge you.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, no,’ says the Maw, ‘we’ll not put you to that trouble;
but perhaps you would come down with us as far as the inn,
and have a bit of lunch.’</p>

<p>‘With all the pleasure in life, sir,’ says the priest, ‘the rather
that I’d like to be discoorsing these larned gentlemen
here;’ but indeed the larned gentlemen didn’t seem a bit too
glad of his company, and small blame to them sure, for may
the heavens be his bed, there wasn’t a funnier man in the nine
counties, or one fonder of followin’ up a joke, an’ well they
knew he wasn’t goin’ to let them down aisy.</p>

<p>It wasn’t long until we were on the road again, makin’ for
the town; an’ as we were goin’ along, who did we meet but a
spalpeen from the county Galway, that came over as soon as
he met us to beg among the quality; an’ sure enough he was
as poor-lookin’ a crathur as ever axed a charity. His legs
were bare, and all blue and brackit with could an’ hardship,
an’ the sorra a skreed of dacint clothin’ he had on him but an
ould tattered breeches an’ a blanket thrown over his shoulders
and fastened at the throat with a big skiver; he had a bag on
his back, an’ a mether in one fist, an’ a boolteen in the other;
an’ if he had any more wealth about him, sure enough it was
hid safely. By the discoorse we had one with another, he
soon larned about the big stone, and how it puzzled all the
scholars in the parish, not to say them from Dublin, an’ how
the priest refused to read it because it was magic; and betther
nor all, how the Maw offered five goold guineas to any
poor scholar, or the like, that could explain it.</p>

<p>‘I’d like to see that stone,’ says the spalpeen. ‘Poor-lookin’
as I am,’ says he, ‘maybe I could insinse ye into the maining
of it.’</p>

<p>Well, sir, the words were scarce out of his mouth when
Mac Coghlan was tould of them. ‘What’s that you say, honest
man,’ says he; ‘can you decypher the writing?’</p>

<p>‘I’d like to try anyhow, yer honour,’ says the spalpeen,
‘worse than fail I can’t.’</p>

<p>‘Bedad,’ says Father Madden, ‘it ’ud be a pity not to let
you; sure if you say you know nothin’ about it, wiser men
nor you had to confess that same; an’ as for us, why, our time
will be as well spent listening to one dunce as to another.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, by all manes,’ says the Maw, ‘we’ll go back and hear
what he makes of it.’ So we all turned back with the spalpeen.</p>

<p>When he came to the stone, it’s a different kind of look he
gave it entirely from what the quality scholars did; you’d
know by the way he fixed his eye on it at the very first, that
it was no saycret to him, an’ he walked up an’ down from one
end of the lines to the other, until he had them all read.</p>

<p>‘Now, my man,’ says the Mac Coghlan, ‘if you read it, the reward
is yours,’ an’ he took the five goold guineas out of his
purse an’ showed them to him.</p>

<p>‘I can read it, yer honour,’ says the spalpeen; ‘but what
it says might be displeasin’ to some of this company, an’ I
had betther hould my tongue.’</p>

<p>‘By my word,’ says Mac Coghlan, ‘let who will be offended
by it, no part of the blame shall rest on your shoulders, so
speak out, an’ speak true.’</p>

<p>‘Well, yer honour,’ says the spalpeen, takin’ courage,
‘what it says is this, that this castle was built on such a time,
an’ that it will stand whole an’ sound for three hundred
years an’ no more; an’ that it’s to be held by eleven Mac
Coghlan heirs, and the eleventh will be the last of his race.’</p>

<p>‘Bad news for the twelfth,’ says Father Madden, ‘to have
an ould stone barrin’ him out of the world that way;’ and
with that they all laughed, all but the Maw, an’ he was as
pale as death an’ stupid-like, for the three hundred years were
just run out, an’ he was the eleventh heir; but in a minute or
two he recovered himself and joined in the laugh as well as
the rest.</p>

<p>‘Well, my man,’ says he at last, ‘you have done what all
the learned men in the land couldn’t do, an’ though the news
isn’t the pleasantest, you must have your reward. Now listen
to me: give up your wandering life and settle here; I’ll give
you a house an’ five acres free of rent for ever: this money
will set you up, an’ I promise you that you shall never want in
my time, short as it is to be. Will you take my offer?’</p>

<p>‘Why, thin,’ says the spalpeen, ‘many thanks by coorse to
yer honour for makin’ it; but for all the land yer honour
has, or one of your name ever had, I wouldn’t live other than
I do: though I’m here now, ’tis many a mile from where I
slept last night, or maybe from where I’ll sleep to-night.
Goold or silver avails me little, or if they did, maybe I could
tell where to find what ’ud buy Galway ten times over.’</p>

<p>‘Bedad, honest man,’ says Father Madden, ‘if you know so
much as all that, it ’ud be a great charity entirely for you to
stop awhile an’ open school here; I’ll be bound you’ll have a
fine lot of scholars, an’ I don’t say but myself ’ud be among
the number.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Troth there’s many a man ’ud like to have my knowledge,
I have no doubt,’ says the spalpeen; ‘but I’m thinkin’ there’s
few here or elsewhere ’ud like to learn in the school where I
got it.’</p>

<p>‘Lord save us!’ says the priest; ‘you didn’t sell yourself
to the ould boy for it, did you, you nasty brute?’</p>

<p>‘I bought it with the past an’ not with the future,’ says the
spalpeen; ‘an’ what ye saw of it is nothing to what I could
show if I had a mind: the blessin’ of the poor be with your
honour, if it be any use to you, an’ it’s wishin’ I am that I had
a luckier story to tell you,’ and he turned to go away.</p>

<p>‘Well, my good fellow,’ says the Maw, ‘any how you’re not
goin’ to quit so soon. Neither gentle nor simple passes this
road without eating with the Mac Coghlan, an’ you must
follow the rule as well as another: stay as long as you like,
an’ go when you like; an’ I give you my word you shall have
the best of tratement, an’ no one shall bother you with any
questions you don’t like.’</p>

<p>‘Yer honour,’ says the spalpeen, ‘I’m not a young man,
an’ yet my head was never this many a night twice on the same
pillow, an’ you’d be a long day findin’ out the spot that in that
time I hav’n’t visited.’</p>

<p>‘Maybe you’re the Wanderin’ Jew,’ exclaimed Father
Madden.</p>

<p>‘Jew or Gentile,’ says the spalpeen, ‘a wanderer I am, an’
a wanderer I must be; an’ now good bye to ye all, an’ God
bless ye;’ and with that away he walked, an’ the never a
sight of him did any one in Banagher lay his eyes on since.
Some said he was this and some said he was that, and more
said he was a sperrit; but what do ye think but the great
scholars from Dublin, to hide their ignorance, gave out that
he was somebody that Father Madden tuthored for the purpose
to make little of thim an’ their larnin’, and have the
laugh against thim.’</p>

<p>Next morning when all the counthry went out of curiosity
to see the big stone, they found it torn down an’ carried off,
for Mac Coghlan got it taken down in the night an’ buried
somewhere; but, any how, it tould nothin’ but the truth, for
in a few years afther, the castle fell with the frost, an’ not long
afther that Mac Coghlan died; an’ sure you know yourself that
he was the last of his name.”</p>

<p class="right">A. M’C.</p>

<p>We should be grateful to any of our correspondents who
would favour us with a biographical sketch of the last Mac
Coghlan, of whom so many stories are still related by the
peasantry of the King’s County, and of whom the following
sketch is given in Mr Brewer’s Beauties of Ireland: it is from
the pen of the late Chevalier Colonel de Montmorency.</p>

<p class="right">P.</p>

<p>“Thomas Coghlan, Esq.&mdash;or, in attention to local phraseology,
‘the Maw’ [that is, Mac], for he was not known or
addressed in his own domain by any other appellation&mdash;was a
remarkably handsome man; gallant, eccentric; proud, satirical;
hospitable in the extreme, and of expensive habits. In
disdain of modern times he adhered to the national customs of
Ireland, and the modes of living practised by his ancestors.
His house was ever open to strangers. His tenants held their
lands at will, and paid their rents, according to the ancient
fashion, partly in kind, and the remainder in money. ‘The
Maw’ levied the fines of mortmain when a vassal died. He
became heir to the defunct farmer; and no law was admissible,
or practised, within the precincts of Mac Coghlan’s domain,
but such as savoured of the Brehon code. It must be observed,
however, that, most commonly, ‘the Maw’s’ commands,
enforced by the impressive application of his horse-whip,
instantly decided a litigated point! From this brief
outline it might be supposed that we were talking of Ireland
early in the seventeenth century, but Mr Coghlan died not
longer back than about the year 1790. With him perished
the rude grandeur of his long-drawn line. He died without
issue, and destitute of any legitimate male representative to
inherit his name, although most of his followers were of the
sept of the Coghlans, none of whom, however, were strictly
qualified, or were suffered by ‘the Maw,’ to use the Mac, or
to claim any relationship with himself. His great estate passed
at his decease to the son of his sister, the late Right Hon.
Denis Bowes Daly, of Daly’s-town, county of Galway, who
likewise had no children, and who, shortly before his death in
1821, sold the Mac Coghlan estate to divers persons, the chief
purchaser being Thomas Bernard, Esq. M. P., in whom the
larger proportion of the property is now vested.”</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE ROYAL FAMILY OF STATEN-ISLAND.</h2>

<p>It has long been the general belief that the gipsy race, which
is found every where else, has never yet penetrated into America;
but the opinion is erroneous. There is a family on
Staten-Island whose history and habits prove their Zingaro
descent, despite the counter evidence of their white skins,
patches of which may be seen through the rents of their tatters,
like intervals of blue sky in a clouded empyrean.</p>

<p>The patriarch of the horde was in his lifetime reputed an
Englishman, although upon this point no intelligence exists
in any parish register or book of heraldry&mdash;a matter the less to
be regretted that his birth is not likely to be disputed by rival
nations or cities. All that is certainly known of him is, that
he made his appearance on the island about forty years ago,
an incarnation of laziness and pauperism, accompanied by a
biped of the feminine gender, whom, as God made her, we are
content to call a woman: they evinced no desire to hold fellowship
with their kind, but immediately plunged into the
woods, where they pertinaciously hid whatever talents and
merits they possessed. Probably the world used them ill, and
like Timon they had left it in disgust. They built themselves
a hut of brushwood, and lived, unknowing and unknown, upon
the wild products of the soil and the sea-shore, the world forgetting
and the world forgot. No one was favoured with any
notice of their former history; they wrought not for hire, nor
did they seek to render themselves in the slightest degree useful
to their fellow-creatures. They were satisfied with a bare,
mysterious existence, the objects of wonder and pity; and
only proved themselves human by increasing the population of
Staten-Land with ten sons and daughters.</p>

<p>In time the he-patriarch died, and his fame died with him;
but not till he had so indoctrinated his hopeful family, that
they have ever since followed his praiseworthy example.
A short time since we paid these Children of the Mist a visit
at their residence, profiting by one of a thousand changes of
abode which brought them within an easy walk of the Quarantine-Ground.
Others may seek objects of interest abroad;
we are content with what may be found near home; and in
this singular family we found a happy practical illustration of
the Golden Age, which poets so much regret, and agrarian
politicians so devoutly hope and expect to restore. By the
margin of a stagnant swamp, rife with malaria and intermittent
fever, embosomed in thick woods, stood a pen of rough
boards, obtained heaven knows how, about ten feet square,
into which about fifty specimens of animal life, human and canine,
were crowded. The den was roofed over, and refused
entrance to the sun, but was by no means so inhospitable to
the rain. The four winds of heaven sought and found free
ingress and egress through the chinks; the floor was not; and
altogether we have seen much better appointed pig-styes.
We first discovered our proximity to this Temple of the
Winds by the greeting of a herd of sorry curs, who made a
great noise, but retreated snarling, and with averted tails, at
the first exhibition of a stone or a stick, as the dogs of the
aborigines are wont to do. A shrill, cracked, but clear voice
from within, uplifted in energetic objurgation, stilled the clamour,
and we entered upon a scene that beggars and defies
description. We had seen poverty before, but had never an
adequate conception of its extreme until now.</p>

<p>A bundle of rags, endowed with suspicious and alarming
powers of locomotion, advanced to do the honours of the mansion.
An unearthly squeak, that would have driven a parrot
of any ear distracted, proclaimed that the thing was human;
and after close inspection we made out a set of features which
we could only have supposed to belong to Calvin Edson or
the Witch of Endor. The head surmounted a withered atomy,
from which every muscular fibre seemed to have dried away.
There was nothing left for Decay to prey upon: a particle more
of waste, and the fabric must have evaporated, or been scattered
with the first puff, like a pinch of snuff. This was the
worthy mother of the brood. Age could not make her head
whiter. She must have been more than a century old, and
yet hearing, vision, speech, every faculty, was unimpaired, and
she was as brisk as any of the horde. According to all appearances,
Time had lost all power over her, and she may yet
live longer than the everlasting pyramids. Fancy a mummy
stalking from its case, and you have some idea of this spectral
apparition.</p>

<p>Around the den were arranged without arrangement four
rude bedsteads, guiltless then and for ever of beds, or any
succedaneum therefor; those being unnecessary and enervating<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
luxuries, in the opinion of the inmates. Not one of these
was born in a bed, or had ever pressed one, and why should
they not do as they had ever done? The only purpose of the
frames seemed to be to keep them from dying on the bare
earth. The whole score and a half of humanities might have
possessed some four or five threadbare and tattered blankets,
such a stock of clothing as might have furnished forth one respectable
scarecrow, and perhaps half a shirt among them;
but of the latter item we are somewhat uncertain, as we considered
any particular scrutiny especially indelicate. The
hut was literally full of trumpery, the use of most of which it
were difficult even to guess. The following, as nearly as memory
serves us, is a correct inventory:&mdash;</p>

<p>An old worn-out saddle; three steel-traps; fifteen dogs,
bitches, and puppies; about a crate full of damaged crockery
and pottery; an iron pot, without a bale or cover, and two
legs off; a tin kettle, with three holes in the bottom; a fish-spear,
an axe, a dozen fishing-rods and tackle; as many rags
as would set up a paper mill; about a peck of clams, a damaged
bucket, and a great variety of other things nameless
ans indescribable.</p>

<p>These true philosophers all appeared to enjoy the most robust
health, with one exception, who was shaking with a paroxysm
of ague on one of the frames before mentioned. The
men were stout, hearty fellows, who might do their country
good service at the tail of a plough or the end of a musket;
but their ambition does not soar so high. They literally take
no thought for to-morrow, though they very well know what
a day must bring forth. They justly consider themselves</p>

<div class="verse">&mdash;&mdash;“out of Fortune’s power;</div>
<div class="verse">He that is down can fall no lower.”</div>
</div>
</div>

<p>Once in a great while they may be persuaded to perform a
day’s labour, but these are rare and painful occasions, always
followed by regret and repentance; and when their immediate
wants are supplied, they return to the luxurious and indolent
repose, which is their second nature, and which they enjoy
in a perfection only appreciable by the Neapolitan lazzaroni.
When they have thus been compelled to pass a night under a
roof, it has been remarked that no human logic can persuade
one of them to submit to the abhorred contact of soap and water,
or to sleep in a bed, suppose any person could be found willing
so to accommodate them. They own no boats, and they
neither hire nor borrow them. Such property requires care
and trouble, and rowing is laborious. A cow was once the
apex of their ambition; but hunger knocks often at their door,
and was fatal to poor Brindle. They are not rich enough to
buy a gun. The conies, partridges, snapping-tortoises, frogs,
squirrels, and such small deer, are their flocks and herds, and
the earth produces wild artichokes and other esculent roots.
As for their religion, they believe in beef and bread, and go
to church, like parasitical insects, as often as they are carried.
They believe that the earth is flat, and that the city of New
York and the Narrows are its limits. To be hung up in a
cage in the sunshine, with licence to scratch themselves, and
to be well fed, constitutes their notion of heaven; and the
county alms-house, where able-bodied people are constrained
to work, is the purgatory of their imagination, or something
worse. They think it is better to sleep than to be awake,
to lie than to sit, to sit than to stand, to stand than to walk,
and to walk than to run. Dancing is to them an incomprehensible
abomination. They own no lord, they heed no law.
They have nothing, and they want nothing. To cold, heat,
rain, &amp;c., they are perfectly indifferent, and their only known
evil is pain, which comes to them only in the shape of hunger
and intermittent fever. Nerves and delicacy they never heard
of. Thus have they ever lived, and thus they will die.</p>

<p>The women at the time of our visit differed from the men
only in attire, a superior volubility, a natural, rough-hewn coquetry,
and the possession of certain brass trinkets, faded
ribbons, and other fantastic fineries. None of them were either
young or handsome enough to mark them as the victims
of man’s villany. The smaller fry about their wretched
cabin attest that they have not in the least neglected the first
command of God to man, though no priest or preacher can
say that he has received a wedding fee on account of either of
them. Their usual employment is to loll upon fences and gather
berries, and they are also said to be skilful in roots and
herbs. Some of them sometimes go to service for a time;
but they soon return to their lair, like a sow to her wallowing
in the mire. The alms-house has also afforded them an asylum
in cases of emergency, but they invariably escape from it
as soon as there is any work to be done. They toil not, neither
do they spin; and assuredly Solomon, with all his wisdom,
never dreamed of such a thing as one of these!</p>

<p>Many have asked, as we did, and many more will ask,
“How do these people live?” Ask Him who feeds the ravens,
for no one else can answer. That they do not work, is certain;
that they neither beg nor steal, is to be inferred from
the fact that their fellow Staten-landers have never accused
them, and that they have never undergone the rebuke of the
law. They are as harmless and inoffensive as they are useless.
They are proverbially good-natured and honest; they
do not get drunk, or abuse tobacco; for although some of
them have a relish for these luxuries, it would cost too much
trouble to earn the price of them. Otherwise, they are the
very Yahoos of Gulliver.</p>

<p>Some philosophers have taught that content is the grand
desideratum, the greatest good of earthly felicity. The contentment
of savages and of negro slaves is brought to support
their position. It is true that these are happy under their
painful and degrading yoke; but what of that? Simon Stylites
was no doubt happy on his pillow of torment: an ox, on
the same principle, and for the same reason, is happier still,
and the life of an oyster is bliss superlative. “The royal family
of Staten-Island” are an example before our eyes to show
how closely contentment may be allied with the extremes of
degradation.&mdash;<cite>From the Knickerbocker.</cite></p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE REAL “TEMPERANCE CORDIAL.”<br />
<span class="smaller">BY MRS S. C. HALL.</span></h2>

<p>“Well,” said Andrew Furlong to James Lacey, “well!
that ginger cordial, of all the things I ever tasted, is the
nicest and warmest. It’s beautiful stuff; and so cheap.”</p>

<p>“What good does it do ye, Andrew? and what want have
you of it?” inquired James Lacey.</p>

<p>“What good does it do me!” repeated Andrew, rubbing
his forehead in a manner that showed he was perplexed by
the question; “why, no great good, to be sure; and I can’t
say I’ve any want of it; for since I became a member of the
‘Total Abstinence Society,’ I’ve lost the megrim in my
head and the weakness I used to have about my heart. I’m
as strong and hearty in myself as any one can be, God be
praised! And sure, James, neither of us could turn out in
such a coat as <em>this</em>, this time twelvemonth.”</p>

<p>“And that’s true,” replied James; “but we must remember
that if leaving off whisky enables us to show a good habit,
taking to ‘ginger cordial,’ or any thing of that kind,
will soon wear a hole in it.”</p>

<p>“You are always fond of your fun.” replied Andrew.
“How can you prove that?”</p>

<p>“Easy enough,” said James. “Intoxication was the worst
part of a whisky-drinking habit; but it was not the only bad
part. It spent <span class="smcapuc">TIME</span>, and it spent what well-managed time always
gives, <span class="smcapuc">MONEY</span>. Now, though they do say&mdash;mind, I’m not
quite <em>sure</em> about it, for they <em>may</em> put things in it they don’t
own to, and your eyes look brighter, and your cheek more
flushed than if you had been drinking nothing stronger than
milk or water&mdash;but they <em>do</em> say that ginger cordials, and all
kinds of cordials, do not intoxicate. I will grant this; but you
cannot deny that they waste both time and money.”</p>

<p>“Oh, bother!” exclaimed Andrew. “I only went with two
or three other boys to have a glass, and I don’t think we spent
more than half an hour&mdash;<em>not</em> three quarters, certainly; and
there’s no great harm in laying out a penny or twopence that
way, now and again.”</p>

<p>“<em>Half</em> an hour even, breaks a day,” said James, “and
what is worse, it unsettles the mind for work; and we
ought to be very careful of any return to the <em>old habit</em>, that
has destroyed many of us, body and soul, and made the
name of an Irishman a by-word and a reproach, instead of
a glory and an honour. A penny, Andrew, <em>breaks the silver
shilling into coppers</em>; and twopence will buy half a stone of
potatoes&mdash;that’s a consideration. If we don’t manage to keep
things comfortable at home, the women won’t have the heart
to mend the coat. Not,” added James with a sly smile, “that
I can deny having taken to <span class="smcapuc">TEMPERANCE CORDIALS</span> myself.”</p>

<p>“You!” shouted Andrew, “<em>you</em>, and a pretty fellow you are
to be blaming me, and then forced to confess you have taken
to them yourself. But I suppose they’ll wear no hole in <em>your</em>
coat? Oh, to be sure not, <em>you</em> are such a good manager!”</p>

<p>“Indeed,” answered James, “I <em>was</em> anything but a good
manager eighteen months ago: as you well know, I was in
rags, never at my work of a Monday, and seldom on Tuesday.
My poor wife, my gentle patient Mary, often bore hard
words; and though she will not own it, I fear still harder
blows, when I had driven away my senses. My children
were pale, half-starved, naked creatures, disputing a potato
with the pig my wife tried to keep to pay the rent, well
knowing I would never do it. Now&mdash;&mdash;”</p>

<p>“But the cordial, my boy!” interrupted Andrew, “the
cordial!&mdash;sure I believe every word of what you’ve been telling
me is as true as gospel; ain’t there hundreds, ay, thousands,
at this moment on Ireland’s blessed ground, that can
tell the same story. But the cordial! and to think of your
never owning it before: is it ginger, or anniseed, or peppermint?”</p>

<p>“None of these&mdash;and yet it’s the <em>rale</em> thing, my boy.”</p>

<p>“Well, then,” persisted Andrew, “let’s have a drop of it;
you’re not going, I’m sure, to drink by yerself&mdash;<em>and as I’ve
broke the afternoon</em>”&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A very heavy shadow passed over James’s face, for he saw
that there must have been something hotter than even ginger
in the “<em>temperance</em> cordial,” as it is falsely called, that Andrew
had taken, or else he would have endeavoured to redeem
lost time, not to waste more; and he thought how much better
the <span class="smcapuc">REAL</span> temperance cordial was, that, instead of exciting
the brain, only warms the heart.</p>

<p>“No,” he replied after a pause, “I must go and finish
what I was about; but this evening at seven o’clock meet me
at the end of our lane, and then I’ll be very happy of your
company.”</p>

<p>Andrew was sorely puzzled to discover what James’s cordial
could be, and was forced to confess to himself that he hoped it
would be different from what he had taken that afternoon,
which certainly had made him feel confused and inactive.</p>

<p>At the appointed hour the friends met in the lane.</p>

<p>“Which way do we go?” inquired Andrew.</p>

<p>“Home,” was James’s brief reply.</p>

<p>“Oh, you <em>take</em> it at home?” said Andrew.</p>

<p>“I <em>make</em> it at home,” answered James.</p>

<p>“Well,” observed Andrew, “that’s very good of the woman
<em>that owns ye</em>. Now, mine takes on so about a drop of any
thing, that she’s as hard almost on the cordials as she used
to be on the whisky.”</p>

<p>“My Mary helps to make mine,” observed James.</p>

<p>“And do you bottle it or keep it on draught?” inquired
Andrew, very much interested in the “cordial” question.</p>

<p>James laughed very heartily at this, and answered,</p>

<p>“Oh, I keep mine on draught&mdash;always on draught; there’s
nothing like having plenty of a good thing, so I keep mine
always on draught;” and then James laughed again, and so
heartily, that Andrew thought surely <em>his</em> real temperance cordial
must contain something quite as strong as what he had
blamed him for taking.</p>

<p>James’s cottage door was open, and as they approached it
they saw a good deal of what was going forward within. A
square table, placed in the centre of the little kitchen, was
covered by a clean white cloth&mdash;knives, forks, and plates for
the whole family, were ranged upon it in excellent order; the
hearth had been swept, the house was clean, the children rosy,
well dressed, and all doing something. “Mary,” whom her
husband had characterised as “the patient,” was busy and
bustling, in the very act of adding to the coffee, which was
steaming on the table, the substantial accompaniments of fried
eggs and bacon, with a large dish of potatoes. When the
children saw their father, they ran to meet him with a great
shout, and clung around to tell him all they had done that
day. The eldest girl declared she had achieved the heel
of a stocking; one boy wanted his father to come and see how
straight he had planted the cabbages; while another avowed
his proficiency in addition, and volunteered to do a sum instanter
upon a slate which he had just cleaned. Happiness<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
in a cottage seems always more real than it does in a
gorgeous palace. It is not wasted in large rooms&mdash;it is concentrated&mdash;a
great deal of love in a small space&mdash;a great,
<em>great</em> deal of joy and hope within narrow walls, and compressed,
as it were, by a low roof. Is it not a blessed thing
that the most moderate means become enlarged by the affections?&mdash;that
the love of a peasant within his sphere, is as deep,
as fervent, as true, as lasting, as sweet, as the love of a prince?&mdash;that
all our best and purest affections will grow and expand
in the poorest <em>worldly</em> soil?&mdash;and that we need not be rich to
be happy? James felt all this and more when he entered his
cottage, and was thankful to God who had opened his eyes,
and taught him what a number of this world’s gifts, that were
within even his humble reach, might be enjoyed without sin.
He stood&mdash;a poor but happy father within the sacred temple of
his home; and Andrew had the warm heart of an Irishman
beating in his bosom, and consequently shared his joy.</p>

<p>“I told you,” said James, “I had the <em>true temperance
cordial</em> at home&mdash;do you not see it in the simple prosperity
by which, owing to the blessings of temperance, I am surrounded?&mdash;do
you not see it in the rosy cheeks of my children,
in the smiling eyes of my wife&mdash;did I not tell truly that she
helped to make it? Is not this a true cordial,” he continued,
while his own eyes glistened with manly tears, “is not the
prosperity of this cottage a <em>true temperance cordial</em>?&mdash;and is
it not <em>always on draught</em>, flowing from an ever-filling fountain?
Am I not right, Andrew; and will you not forthwith
take my receipt, and make it for yourself? You will never
wish for any other: it is warmer than ginger, and sweeter
than anniseed. I am sure you will agree with me that a
loving wife, in the enjoyment of the humble comforts which
an industrious <em>sober</em> husband can bestow, smiling, healthy,
well-clad children, and a clean cabin, where the fear of God
banishes all other fears, make</p>

<p class="center">THE TRUE TEMPERANCE CORDIAL!”</p>

<h2 class="gap4">THE SAP IN VEGETABLES.</h2>

<h3>FIRST ARTICLE.</h3>

<p>Botanists describe two kinds of vegetable sap; the one is
called the ascending or unelaborated sap, the other the descending
or elaborated sap. If a young branch be cut across
in the spring season, the newly exposed surfaces will be found
rapidly to cover themselves with a dew, especially that portion
which is continuous with the trunk&mdash;this moisture is the
ascending sap: while if during the summer or autumn a piece
of twine be tightly drawn and knotted round a young branch
of lilac, the part above this ligature will shortly become swollen,
and will bulge out on every side, in consequence of an
impediment having been thus presented to the downward flow
of the descending sap, which will be therefore forced to accumulate
in the situation described. The reader may perceive
that the origin from whence these two kinds of sap are derived,
their chemical composition, the part of the vegetable through
which they pass, the causes which produce the ascent of one
and the descent of the other, together with the uses of both
in the vegetable economy, are questions of great interest, as
well to the farmer as the horticulturist.</p>

<p>The source from whence the ascending sap is derived is the
aliment absorbed by the roots from the soil. This aliment
consists essentially of two substances; one of these being
sufficiently familiar, namely, water; and the other commonly
existing in the atmosphere under the form of gas or air, but
likewise capable of solution in water, namely, carbonic acid;
this substance is known to every one as the cause, by its
escape, of the boiling appearance seen in freshly uncorked
soda water. Those two substances constitute the necessary
aliment of vegetables: at the same time it is notorious that
various matters, such as manures, earths, &amp;c., greatly facilitate
the growth of plants; but these matters produce this
effect either by supplying a greater quantity of carbonic acid,
or by acting in a manner similar to condiments; for in the
same way as spices taken into the stomach along with food
invigorate the digestive power, so do many minerals, when
absorbed by the roots, operate in promoting the nutrition of
vegetables.</p>

<p>The chemical composition of the ascending sap is chiefly a
solution of sugar and gum in water. In the northern states
of America, sugar in large quantities is obtained from some
species of maple, principally the sugar maple and swamp maple
of Canada, by boring the stem, collecting the ascending
sap which flows from the wound, and evaporating away its
watery portions. It is an interesting question, from whence
proceed the sugar and gum contained in this ascending sap?
The only satisfactory reply to this question is, that these substances
become formed out of the water and carbonic acid
absorbed from the soil; but this is a transformation which
cannot be effected by the most expert chemist, so that we
find in this, as in many other instances, a living body is a
laboratory in which Nature executes changes far transcending
the loftiest efforts of man’s ingenuity.</p>

<p>The part of the vegetable through which the sap ascends can
be easily shown in any of the ordinary trees of this country.
If a branch from a currant shrub be placed with its inferior
and newly cut surface immersed at first in a solution of green
vitriol and afterwards in an infusion of nutgalls, the course
through which these fluids ascend may be traced by the black
colour produced by their mixture; for every one knows that
a mixture of green vitriol and nutgalls produces ink, and in
the experiment just described, the solutions of these substances
following each other in their ascent, inscribe in a manner on
the interior of the branch the path which they successively
pursued. This course will be found to exist between the bark
and the pith, these parts being quite unchanged, while the intermediate
portion of wood will be deeply coloured.</p>

<p>The causes which produce the ascent of the sap are of a very
powerful nature. The celebrated Hales ascertained that a vine
branch, in a few days, sucked up water with a force equal to
the weight of sixteen pounds on the square inch: this was a
power greater than atmospheric pressure; and when it is recollected
that the pressure of the atmosphere is capable of
lifting thirty-three or thirty-four feet of water in a common
pump, some estimate may be formed of the force with which
the sap ascends. This ascent appears to be produced by the
influence of two causes: the one, a quality peculiar to living
beings, by which the buds in common with all growing organs
are capable of attracting or sucking towards them the juices
necessary for their nutrition; and in agreement with this, the
sap is found to ascend in the first instance near the buds: the
other, a general property of all matter which has been but
lately discovered. This latter property, which has been called
endosmose, is found to operate when two fluids of different densities
are separated by a membrane. Under these circumstances,
and in obedience to an attraction for each other,
both fluids pass through the membrane, and mix together;
but the denser and thicker fluid finding a greater difficulty to
penetrate the membrane than the lighter and thinner, consequently
passes through in less quantity. To illustrate this,
let us suppose a bladder containing a little syrup, and placed
in a vessel of water, and we will have the conditions necessary
for endosmose: the syrup and water will both pass through
the bladder in opposite directions, but a greater quantity of
water will pass into the syrup, than of the latter into the
water. It will be evident to the reader that this excess of
thin liquid passing into the denser will constitute a force or
power which will require an equal force to neutralise it; and
it has been ascertained that the tendency of water to penetrate
a membrane for the purpose of mixing with a syrup of
once and a third its own specific weight, required a force
equal to sixty-three pounds on the square inch to overcome it.
Now, a plant growing in the ground is similarly circumstanced
to the bladder in this experiment: its roots furnished
with extremities of spongy membrane are interposed between
thin water and carbonic acid externally, and a syrupy solution
of sugar and gum internally. Now, under those circumstances
we need not be surprised if an endosmose should operate,
abundantly sufficient to elevate the sap with a force even
greater than that determined by Hales.</p>

<p>The use of the ascending sap in the vegetable economy is
the last subject which we shall consider in this article. On a
future occasion we shall endeavour to show that it is out of
the ascending sap that the descending or elaborated sap is
chiefly formed; but besides this utility of the ascending sap,
as the source of the descending sap, the former has special
functions of its own to perform. If we inquire what period of
the year is the ascending sap in greatest quantity, we shall
find it to be during the spring season. Now, this is the time
when the buds become pushed out into branches, and the young
leaves peep forth: the roots also during this season increase
in thickness. Another means which we possess of ascertaining
the uses of this sap, is by protecting plants from the influence
of light: in total darkness no elaborated sap is ever
formed; therefore, whatever vegetation may then take place,
must be solely at the expense of the ascending sap. Under such<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
circumstances the plant becomes very succulent, its stems
grow to a great length, no vegetable fibre can be detected in
its substance, its colour is blanched, it possesses no bitter or
aromatic properties, and it does not develope flowers. Potatoes
growing in a dark cellar, or celery protected from the
light, by earth heaped around its foot-stalks, will afford
familiar examples. These considerations lead us to the belief
that out of the ascending sap is formed the fleshy part of
vegetables, which, by its production, increases the length of
the stem, and the thickness of the roots. In our next article
we will describe the most remarkable properties of the ascending
sap.</p>

<p class="right">T. A.</p>

<h2 class="gap4">MEN OF GENIUS.</h2>

<p>Have any of our friends any persons of this description
amongst the young men of their acquaintance? We think
they must, for they are very plentiful: they are to be found
every where. We ourselves know somewhere about half a
dozen of one kind or other; and it is of these different kinds
we purpose here to speak.</p>

<p>Before doing this, however, let us remark, that the sort of
geniuses to whom we allude are to be found amongst young
men only: for, generally speaking, it is only while men <em>are</em>
young that they are subject to the delusion of supposing themselves
geniuses. As they advance in life, they begin to suspect
that there has been some mistake in the matter. A few
years more, and they become convinced of it; when, wisely
dropping all pretensions to the character, they step quietly
back into the ranks amongst their fellows.</p>

<p>It is true that some old fools, especially amongst the poetical
tribe, continue to cling to the unhappy belief of their being
gifted, and go on writing maudlin rhymes to the end of the
chapter. But most men become in time alive to the real state
of the case, and, willingly resigning the gift of genius, are
thankful to find that they have common sense.</p>

<p>While under the hallucination alluded to, however, the sort
of geniuses of whom we speak are rather amusing subjects of
study. We have known a great many of them in our day, and
have found that they resolve themselves into distinct classes,
such classes being formed by certain differing characteristics
and pretensions: the individuals of each class, however, presenting
in their peculiarities a striking resemblance to each
other.</p>

<p>First comes, at any rate in such order shall we take them,
the Poetical Genius. This is a poor, bleached-faced thing, with
a simpering, self-satisfied countenance, an effeminate air and
manner, and of insufferable conceit. It is an insolent creature
too, for it treats you and everybody with the most profound
contempt. Its calm, confident smirk, and lack-a-daisical
look, are amongst the most provoking things in nature,
and always inspire you with a violent desire to kick it out of
your presence.</p>

<p>The poetical genius is by far the most useless of the whole
tribe of geniuses. Wrapt up in his misty, maudlin dreams of
cerulean heavens, and daisied meads, and purling rills, he is
totally unfitted for the ordinary business of ordinary life. He
is besides not unfrequently a little deranged in his upper
works. Having heard, or having of himself imbibed a notion,
that madness and genius are allied, he, although of perfectly
sane mind originally, takes to raving, to staring wildly about
him, and to practising various of the other extravagances of
insanity, till he becomes actually half cracked: some of them
indeed get stark staring mad.</p>

<p>The poetical genius is addicted to tea parties, and to
writing in albums. He also much affects the society of
tabbies: for of all his admirers he finds them the most liberal
and indiscriminate in their praise. These good creatures
drench him with weak tea, and he in return doses them with
still weaker poetry. This is the class that supplies the newspapers
with the article just named, at least so named by
courtesy, figuring therein as J. F.’s and P. D.’s, &amp;c.</p>

<p>The next class of geniuses which we propose to consider, is
the Oratorical Genius. This person labours under the delusion
of supposing himself a second Demosthenes. He is a
great frequenter of debating societies, and other similar associations,
where he makes long, prosy, unintelligible speeches&mdash;speeches
full of mist and moonshine, in which no human being
can discover the slightest trace of drift or purpose. These
frothy, bubble-and-squeak orations the young gentleman prepares
at home, fitting himself and them for public exhibition
by raving and ranting them over in his own room, to the great
annoyance of his neighbours.</p>

<p>These speeches, when they do not produce nausea, which
they are very apt to do, or at least a disagreeable feeling of
squeamishness, are powerful soporifics, and, possessing this
quality, would be rather grateful than otherwise, if one were
in bed when within hearing of them; but unhappily this pleasant
effect is neutralised by the roaring and stamping that
accompanies their delivery: so that this sort of orator is in
reality a positive nuisance.</p>

<p>The oratorical genius is nearly, if not every bit, as conceited
as the poetical genius. He has the same provoking,
self-satisfied simper, and is in other respects a still greater
bore, for his forensic habits and practices, without furnishing
him with a single additional idea, have given him an unhappy
fluency of speech, which he himself mistakes for eloquence,
and with which he mercilessly inundates every one whom he
can get beneath the spout of his oratorical pump. Every
thing he says to you is said in set phrase&mdash;in the stiff, formal,
affected language of the debating society. His remarks on
the most ordinary subjects are all regular built speeches&mdash;dull,
long-winded, prosy things, smelling strong of the forum.</p>

<p>We know a speculative or debating society man the moment
he opens his mouth. We know him by his studied, prolix
phraseology, and much, much do we dread him, for of all
earthly bores he is the most intolerable. To be obliged to
listen to his maudlin philosophy and misty metaphysics&mdash;for
they are all to a man philosophers or metaphysicians&mdash;is
about one of the most distressing inflictions we know.</p>

<p>The next genius on our list is the Universal Genius, perhaps
the most amusing of the whole fraternity. This gentleman,
although perfectly satisfied that he is a genius, and a
very great genius too, does not know himself precisely in what
he excels. He has no definite ideas on the subject, and in this
respect is rather at a loss. But he enjoys a delightful consciousness
of a capacity that would enable him to surpass in
anything to which he might choose to devote himself, and that
in fact he does surpass in everything. His pretensions therefore
rest on a very broad basis, and embrace all human attainments.
He is in short a universal genius. This gentleman
is very apt to assume peculiarities in dress and exterior
appearance, to wear odd things in an odd way, and to sport
a few eccentricities because he has heard or imagines that all
geniuses are eccentric. These are common and favourite expedients
with the would-be genius, who moreover frequently
adds dissipation to his distinguishing characteristics, it being
a pretty general notion that genius is drunken, and of a wild
and irregular life.</p>

<p>To make out this character, then, the universal genius
takes to breaking the public lamps, wrenching off bell-handles,
kicking up rows in taverns with the waiters and others,
and on the streets with the police; gets his head broken and
his eyes blackened; keeps late hours, and goes home drunk
every night; and thus becomes a genius of the first order.
This sort of genius, we have observed, is much addicted to
wearing odd sorts of head-dresses, fantastic caps all befurred
and betasselled, and moreover greatly affects the bare throat,
or wearing only an apology for a neckcloth, with shirt-collar
turned down&mdash;in this aiming at a fine wild brigandish sort of
look and appearance, much coveted by geniuses of a certain
order.</p>

<p>Nature, however, does not always favour those ambitious
attempts at the bold and romantic, for we often find them associated
with snub noses, lantern jaws, and the most stupid
and unmeaning countenances, that express anything but a
consonance of character with pretension. We have known
geniuses of this kind&mdash;the bare-necked and turned-down-collared&mdash;set
up for romantic desperadoes on the strength of a
hairy throat and a pair of bushy whiskers.</p>

<p>The great class of universal geniuses now under consideration
may, on close inspection, be found to subdivide itself
into several minor classes, including the Sublime Genius, the
Solemn Genius, and another tribe which has hitherto been, we
rather think, without a name, but which we shall take the
liberty of calling the Dirty Genius. This is a curious species
of the race. The dirty genius delights in unkempt locks,
which he not only allows but encourages to hang about his
face and behind on his coat collar, in large tangled filthy
looking masses. He delighteth also in an unwashed face, in
dirty linen, and in a general slovenliness and shabbiness of
apparel. The pretensions of this genius are very high; for
he affects to be superior to all the common observances of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span>
civilised life; its courtesies and amenities he holds in the
most sovereign contempt; despises soap and water, and rises
proudly above white stockings and clean shirts.</p>

<p>There are several other descriptions of geniuses, on each of
which we could say an edifying word or two, but reserve them
for another occasion.</p>

<p class="right">C.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Anecdote of the late Mr Bradbury, the celebrated
Clown.</span>&mdash;In the year 1814, when Mr Bradbury was
in the heyday of his popularity, he lodged in Portsmouth, in
the well-known and elegant establishment called the Crown
Hotel, then kept by a Mr Hanna, where a number of the fashionable
and gay daily resorted. It happened at a dinner
party where a considerable number were present, Mr Bradbury
introduced a most splendid gold snuff-box which had
been shortly before presented to him by the members of a convivial
club to which he belonged, in token of their estimation
of him as a convivial friend and of his talents in his line of
acting, which qualities he was known to possess in a very
high degree. This box he highly prized, and it was sent
round the table and admired by all. After some time, however,
it was found not to be forthcoming. Every one stared&mdash;no
one had it&mdash;all had seen it the moment before, but could
not tell what could possibly have become of it. In vain the
owner entreated every gentleman to search his pocket, as some
one might have taken it inadvertently. All tried without success.
After remaining an hour in the greatest anxiety, in
which the company seemed to participate, they separated.
Mr Bradbury consulted some of his friends on this very unpleasant
business, who advised him to send for a Bow Street
officer, who might from his habits be able to suggest some
means of detection. This advice was instantly followed, and
Rivett, the well-known peace-officer, was sent for. The same
company met next day at dinner, and the most anxious inquiries
were made by all for the box, but still no account of
it. Amongst the company was a Captain C&mdash;&mdash;, who was
aide-de-camp to General Leake, who was then going out to
India, and waiting for the first fair wind. This gentleman
was the first to quit the room after dinner, and by a preconcerted
arrangement was followed into his bedroom by Rivett,
who was waiting outside. Mr Bradbury also followed; and
it was immediately communicated to Captain C&mdash;&mdash; that he
must submit to a search, a warrant for that purpose having
been obtained against every gentleman in the room. This
was instantly submitted to in the most cheerful manner by
Captain C&mdash;&mdash;, who invited them to make it, and expressed
great satisfaction at such a course as the only means of detection;
but he could not bring himself to believe that any
gentleman could be guilty of so infamous an act except through
inadvertence. After his trunk and dressing-case had been
searched, he hoped they were perfectly satisfied of his integrity
in the business. Rivett, however, observed that as far
the search was made, he was satisfied that all was correct,
and nothing now remained but to search his person. These
words were scarcely uttered when he was observed to change
colour and stagger; a smothered groan escaped him, and he
fell back in a chair; and in a state scarcely conscious of existence,
the box was taken from his pocket. He remained in
this state of stupor for a few moments, whilst Bradbury and
the peace-officer stood looking at each other, scarcely believing
the evidence of their senses; and recovering himself a
little, he stood up, gazed wildly at one and then at the other,
and gasping with the intensity of his feelings, he rushed to
his dressing-table, and like lightning drew a razor across his
throat. Surgical assistance being on the spot, the wound was
first pronounced not to be mortal. The effect of the scene&mdash;the
look of the man&mdash;his maniac look, and the act or desperation
accompanying it&mdash;his rank in life, and every circumstance
connected with it, had such an effect on poor Bradbury that
he lost his reason, and did not recover it for a year afterwards.
The matter could not be kept a secret. The truly
unfortunate and miserable Captain C&mdash;&mdash; of course lost his
commission, and it is not known what afterwards became of
him. There was, however, no prosecution. The punishment
was sufficient.</p>

<p class="right">W. E.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Elevation of the Mind.</span>&mdash;Lofty elevation of mind does
not make one indifferent to the wants and sufferings of those
who are below him: on the contrary, as the rarified air of
mountains makes distant objects seem nearer, so are all his
fellow-beings brought nearer to the heart of him who looks
upon them from the height of his wisdom.</p>

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">Napoleon after Death.</span>&mdash;Death had marvellously improved
the appearance of Napoleon, and every one exclaimed,
when the face was exposed, “How very beautiful!” for all present
acknowledged that they had never seen a finer or more
regular and placid countenance. The beauty of the delicate
Italian features was of the highest kind; whilst the exquisite
serenity of their expression was in the most striking contrast
with the recollections of his great actions, impetuous character,
and turbulent life. As during his eventful career there was
much of the mysterious and inscrutable about him, even after
death Napoleon’s inanimate remains continued a puzzle and a
mystery: for, notwithstanding his great sufferings and the
usual emaciating effects of the malady that destroyed him, the
body was found enormously fat. The frame was as unsusceptible
of material disintegration as the spirit was indomitable.
Over the sternum, or breast bone, which is generally only
thinly covered, there was a coat of fat an inch and a half thick;
and on the abdomen two inches, whilst the omentum, kidneys,
and heart, were loaded with fat. The last organ was remarkably
small, and the muscle flabby, in contradiction to our ideal
associations, and in proof of the seeming paradox, that it is
possible to be a very great man with a very little heart.
Much anxiety was felt at the time to ascertain the disease of
which Bonaparte died. Mr O’Meara had represented the
liver as the faulty organ, and this has been echoed by Antommarchi;
though, as we have said before, the illustrious sufferer
himself, with better judgment, referred the mischief to the
stomach, as its seat and source; and he was perfectly right,
as the event proved. This organ was found most extensively
disorganised: in fact, it was ulcerated all over like a honeycomb.
The focus of the disease was exactly the spot pointed
out by Napoleon&mdash;the pylorus, or lower end where the intestines
begin. At this place I put my finger into a hole, made
by an ulcer, that had eaten through the stomach, but which
was stopped by a slight adhesion to the adjacent liver. After
all, the liver was free from disease, and every organ sound except
the stomach. Several peculiarities were noticed about
the body. He appeared at some time to have had an issue
open in the arm, and there was a slight mark, like a wound,
in the leg, but which might have been caused by a suppurating
boil. The chest was not ample, and there was something of
feminine delicacy in the roundness of the arms and the smallness
of the hands and feet. The head was large in proportion
to the body, with a fine, massy, capacious forehead. In
other respects there were no remarkable developements for
the gratification of phrenologists. The diseased state of the
stomach was palpably and demonstrably the cause of death;
and how Napoleon could have existed for any time with such
an organ, was wonderful, for there was not an inch of it sound.&mdash;<cite>Biography

<p class="gap4"><span class="smcap">The March of Magniloquence</span>&mdash;Is “onward” like the
prosperity of your two-and-sixpenny republic in Central America.
We [the Americans] are becoming so great, that it is
very much to be feared we shall lose all our standards of
commerce. Having nothing <em>little</em>, we don’t see how the deuce
we shall be able to express a diminutive. Our miniature will
all become magnitude, and it is difficult for us to see our way
clearly in the world. Our insects will grow into elephants,
and for aught we see we shall have to speak of the gnat as a
large monster, and the honey-bee have to be described as a
beast of prey. “I does business in this <em>store</em>,” was the remark
made the other day by a dealer in crab apples, as he
crawled out of a refuse molasses-hogshead with his peck basket
of merchandise. The skippers of the Long Island clam-boats
all call each other <em>captains</em>; and we lately heard a city
scavenger complaining to another gentleman in the same line
of business, that his <em>town house</em> had been endangered during a
recent conflagration: a mischievous cracker-boy had thrown
one of his flaming missiles into the segment of a cellar occupied
by the complainant and his family. Mr Mark Anthony
Potts told us the other day that he had made arrangements
for extending his <em>business</em>. He has taken the superintendence
of two coal carts, having heretofore shovelled for but one.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
